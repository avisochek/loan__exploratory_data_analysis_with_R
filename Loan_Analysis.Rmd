##### BorrowerRate Ranges from 0 to .05

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.2,warning=FALSE}
quantile(loanData$BorrowerRate,.1)
quantile(loanData$BorrowerRate,.9)
```

##### most borrowers have a rate between .1 and .31

##### Most borrowers have a credit score between 600 and 800

##Income

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.12,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$IncomeRange)

##### few loans are given out to individuals with low income, or who are unemployed, no surprises here...

##### let's reorder IncomeRange and create a new variable to indicate weather a borrower is reported as having an income 

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.13,warning=FALSE}
loanData$IncomeRange <- factor(loanData$IncomeRange,levels=c("$75,000-99,999","$50,000-74,999","$25,000-49,999","$1-24,999","$0","Not employed","Not displayed"))

####Other observations:
The majority of loans go to individuals who are employed full time.

Few loans are given out to individuals with low income, or who are unemployed.

Most Borrowers do not have a credit grade.

Loans amounts range from 0 to $35,000. 

75% of loans are for under $12,000.

Nearly all of the loans given out are 100% funded.

Most loans have 0 net principal loss.

Most borrowers have 0 delinquincies in the past 7 years.

Few loans are given out from Q4 2008 through Q2 2009. 

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The main features of interest are LoanOriginationQuarter and BorrowerRate.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

It is hard to say at this point. All variables mentioned above were selected for the investigation because they are likely to have an impact on the borrower rate.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

BorrowerRateCategory <- cut BorrowerRate to the following levels:
[0 - 0.1] , [0.1 - 0.31] , [0.31 - 0.5]

loanData$DebtLevel <- cut DebtToIncomeRatio to the following levels:   
[0 - .3] , [.3 - .49] , [.49-1] ,[1-10.5])

HasCreditGrade <- CreditGrade is available
HasProsperRating <- ProsperRating is available

HasIncome >> IncomeRange is available and greater than 0

#####The following variables are created in later sections:


### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

#####I log transformed the following variables:

DebtToIncomeRatio

StatedMonthlyIncome

#####I reordered the following factor variables:

ProsperScore..Alpha,

CreditGrade,

Incomerange,

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?
The average Borrower Rate was decreasing significantly from 2012 to 2014

The Lower 10% of borrower rates have remained relatively steady

The average Loan amount went down steeply in Q4 2008 and has been rising steadily since then.

## it doesn't look like there is a significant relationship from this graph...

## It looks like there is a trend, although it is still not quite clear..
## I'm going to make a new variable, DebtLevelBucket to make a smoother plot..

###Credit score and ratings----

## Borrowers without a credit grade have borrower rate that is average relative to the others...

Borrower Rate varies significantly by CreditGrade. 


Borrower Rates seem to vary accross states quite a bit. The median borrower rate by state varies from approximately .15 to .2

Occupation has a strong influence on BorrowerRate. Occupations with a higher level of education (i.e. engineer, computer programmer, judge etc..) have borrower rates on the lower end of the spectrum while occupations with a lower level of education (i.e. college freshman, Nurse's Aide, Bus Driver, Laborer), have BorrowerRates on the higher end of the spectrum. Median Borrower rate by occupation varies from approximately .125 to .225
### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

### What was the strongest relationship you found?
The strongest Relationship was between the Borrower Rate and Credit Grade, although
