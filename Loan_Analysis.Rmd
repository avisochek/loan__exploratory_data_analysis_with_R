# Univariate Plots Section

## BorrowerRate, LoanOriginalAmount & Term

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.1,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=BorrowerRate),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.005)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,.5,.02))+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

summary(loanData$BorrowerRate)
```

BorrowerRate Ranges from 0 to .05

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.2,warning=FALSE}
quantile(loanData$BorrowerRate,.1)
quantile(loanData$BorrowerRate,.9)
```

Most BorrowerRates are between .1 and .31.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.3,warning=FALSE}
loanData$BorrowerRateCategory<-cut(loanData$BorrowerRate,c(0,0.1,0.31,0.5),labels=c('low','normal','high'))


ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5000)
summary(loanData$LoanOriginalAmount)
```

all loans are between 0 and 35,000...

75% of loans are under 12,000...

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.4,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=Term),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram()
loanData$Term <-factor(loanData$Term)
```

All loans have a term of either 1,3 or 5 years.

## Borrower Info
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.5,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$EmploymentStatus)
```

The large majority of loans go to individuals who are employed full time.

#### IsBorrowerHomeowner:
```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.6,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$IsBorrowerHomeowner)
```

about half and half

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.7,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$BorrowerState)
```

pretty even distribution by state population

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.8,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$Occupation)
```

## Credit and Ratings

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.9,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha.)
summary(loanData$CreditGrade)
```

A large number of Borrowers either don't have a prosper rating or a credit score...

lets create new variables to indicate weather a user has a credit grade or a prosper rating

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots_1.10,warning=FALSE}
loanData$HasCreditGrade <- !(loanData$CreditGrade==''|is.na(loanData$CreditGrade))
loanData$HasProsperRating <- !(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha.==''|is.na(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha.))
```

I'm also going to switch the order so that AA comes before A

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.11,warning=FALSE}
loanData$CreditGrade <- factor(loanData$CreditGrade, levels =c("AA","A","B","C","D","E","HR","NC",""))
loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha. <- factor(loanData$ProsperRating..Alpha., levels =c("AA","A","B","C","D","E","HR",""))
                               
ggplot(aes(x=CreditScoreRangeLower),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(0,900,20))+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
summary(loanData$CreditScoreRangeLower)
```

Most borrowers have a credit score between 600 and 800

## Income

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.12,warning=FALSE}
summary(loanData$IncomeRange)
```

Few loans are given out to individuals with low income, or who are unemployed, no surprises here.

Let's reorder IncomeRange and create a new variable to indicate weather a borrower is reported as having an income.

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.13,warning=FALSE}
loanData$IncomeRange <- factor(loanData$IncomeRange,levels=c("$100,000+","$75,000-99,999","$50,000-74,999","$25,000-49,999","$1-24,999","$0","Not employed","Not displayed"))

HasIncome <-loanData$IncomeRange == "$75,000-99,999"|loanData$IncomeRange == "$50,000-74,999"|loanData$IncomeRange == "$25,000-49,999"|loanData$IncomeRange == "$1-24,999"

ggplot(aes(StatedMonthlyIncome),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1000)

ggplot(aes(StatedMonthlyIncome),data=subset(loanData,StatedMonthlyIncome>0))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.05)+
  scale_x_log10()

ggplot(aes(StatedMonthlyIncome),data=subset(loanData,StatedMonthlyIncome>0&IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.05)+
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(500,50000),breaks=c(1000,3000,10000,30000))
summary(loanData$StatedMonthlyIncome)
```

## Debt

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.14,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.05)
```

There are a few outliers at 10.0.


```{r echo=FALSE,Univariate_Plotsgh43u,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=DebtToIncomeRatio),data=loanData)+
  scale_x_log10(breaks=c(.01,.03,.1,.3,.49,1,10))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=.1)

summary(loanData$DebtToIncomeRatio)
```

Most debt levels are in the range of 0 to 0.5

## Quarter

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter),data=loanData)+
  geom_bar()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Lets reorder these by time and try again

```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots1.16,warning=FALSE}
loanData$LoanOriginationQuarter <- factor(loanData$LoanOriginationQuarter, levels = c("Q1 2006","Q2 2006","Q3 2006" ,"Q4 2006","Q1 2007","Q2 2007","Q3 2007" ,"Q4 2007","Q1 2008","Q2 2008","Q3 2008" ,"Q4 2008","Q1 2009","Q2 2009","Q3 2009" ,"Q4 2009","Q1 2010","Q2 2010","Q3 2010" ,"Q4 2010","Q1 2011","Q2 2011","Q3 2011" ,"Q4 2011","Q1 2012","Q2 2012","Q3 2012" ,"Q1 2013","Q2 2013","Q3 2013" ,"Q4 2013","Q4 2013","Q1 2014"))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter),data=loanData)+
  geom_bar()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Thats better... we can see here that the number of loans given out dropped dramatically in the last quarter of 2008, ....

#### Other observations.

BorrowerRate Ranges from 0 to .05

Most BorrowRates are between .1 and .31

Loans amounts range from 0 to $35,000. 

75% of loans are for under $12,000.

All loans have a term of either 1,3 or 5 years.

The large majority of loans go to individuals who are employed full time.

A large number of Borrowers either donâ€™t have a prosper rating or don't have a credit score.

Few loans are given out to individuals with low income, or who are unemployed.

The number of loans given out dropped dramatically in the last quarter of 2008

### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?

The main feature of interest for this investigation is the BorrowerRate.

### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?

It is hard to say at this point. All variables mentioned above were selected for the investigation because they are likely to have an impact on the borrower rate.

### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?

HasCreditGrade <- CreditGrade is available

HasProsperRating <- ProsperRating is available

HasIncome >> IncomeRange is available and greater than 0

#####Additional variables are created in later sections

### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?

#####I log transformed the following variables, which had a left leaning distribution:

DebtToIncomeRatio

StatedMonthlyIncome

#####I reordered the following factor variables:

ProsperScore..Alpha,

CreditGrade,

Incomerange,

LoanOrginationQuarter

#####I also subsetted the data for StatedMonthlyIncome by IncomeVerifiable.

# Bivariate Plots Section
## Overview
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots1.1,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=Term),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
with(loanData,by(BorrowerRate,Term,summary))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,y=BorrowerRate,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The average Borrower Rate was decreasing significantly from 2012 to 2014

## Loan Amount

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots4,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,y=LoanOriginalAmount,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat="summary",fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The average Loan amount went down steeply in Q4 2008 and rose steadily until 2014.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots1.cvbncvbn,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=LoanOriginalAmount),data=loanData)+
  geom_point()

## cut loanOriginalAmount by quantiles...
loanData$LoanOriginalAmountQuantile <- cut(loanData$LoanOriginalAmount,
                                          with(subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginalAmount)),
                                               quantile(LoanOriginalAmount,seq(0,1,.15))))
                                          #labels=c('0%','20%','40%','60%','80%'))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=LoanOriginalAmountQuantile),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=LoanOriginalAmountQuantile,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

## Debt Level
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots5,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=log10(DebtToIncomeRatio)),data=loanData)+
  geom_point(alpha=1/20)
```

It doesn't look like there is a significant relationship from this graph.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots6,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=log10(DebtToIncomeRatio)),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median)

## cut loanData by quantiles...
loanData$DebtToIncomeRatioQuantile <- cut(loanData$DebtToIncomeRatio,
                                          with(subset(loanData,!is.na(DebtToIncomeRatio)),
                                               quantile(DebtToIncomeRatio,seq(0,1,.1))),
                                          labels=c('0%','10%','20%','30%','40%','50%','60%','70%','80%','90%'))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=DebtToIncomeRatioQuantile),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

It looks like there is a trend, although it is still not quite clear.


```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots7,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=DebtToIncomeRatioQuantile,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

Debt level quantile and median BorrowerRate are correlated.

## Credit score and ratings
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots8,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=CreditScoreRangeLower),data=loanData)+
  geom_point(alpha=1/20)

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=CreditGrade),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Borrowers without a credit grade have borrower rate that is average relative to the others...

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots9,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=ProsperRating..Alpha.),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Borrower rates are cleanly distributed among the different prosper ratings. (in contrast to the credit grades which overlap...)

Borrowers without a prosper rating have a median borrower rate that is average relative to the others...
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots10,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=CreditScoreRangeLower,x=reorder(CreditGrade,BorrowerRate,FUN=median)),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()

ggplot(aes(y=CreditScoreRangeLower,x=ProsperRating..Alpha.),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Credit score varies much less among different prosper ratings than it does with credit grades...

## Income
(IncomeVerifiable = "True")

#####How closely related are the stated monthly income and the reported IncomeRange? 

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots11,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=IncomeRange,y=StatedMonthlyIncome*12),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=IncomeRange,y=StatedMonthlyIncome*12),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,200000))+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Most borrowers who have an IncomeRange Recorded have a StatedMonthlyIncome that falls within this range, however there are quite a few exceptions.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots11.1,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=IncomeRange),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The Median borrower rate goes down as income range category goes up.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots12,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=StatedMonthlyIncome),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_point()

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=StatedMonthlyIncome),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_point(alpha=1/50)+
  scale_x_log10(limits=c(500,50000))
```


```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots13,warning=FALSE}
loanData$StatedMonthlyIncomeQuantile<-cut(loanData$StatedMonthlyIncome,
                                           with(subset(loanData,!is.na(StatedMonthlyIncome)),
                                                quantile(StatedMonthlyIncome,seq(0,1,.1))),
                                           labels=c('0%','10%','20%','30%','40%','50%','60%','70%','80%','90%'))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=StatedMonthlyIncomeQuantile,group=1),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
  ylab("Median BorrowerRate")
```

There is a clean and linear relationship between the StatedMonthlyIncome Quantile and the Median BorrowerRate.

## Borrower Info
```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots14,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=reorder(EmploymentStatus,BorrowerRate,FUN=median)),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Unemployed borrowers have a significantly higher Median Borrower Rate than the others

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots15,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=IsBorrowerHomeowner),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()
```

Homeowners have a lower median BorrowerRate than non-homeowners.

```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots15.873265987230,warning=FALSE,fig.height=8}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=reorder(BorrowerState, BorrowerRate, FUN=median) ),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```

The worst States to get a loan are Maine and Indiana. The Best States are Alabama and North Dakota

```{r,hajdhgkjahsm,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.height=10}
ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=reorder(Occupation, BorrowerRate,FUN=median )),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```

In General, Higher Paying Occupations with a higher level of education (i.e. Judge, Computer Programmer Engineer) have a lower median borrower rate than lower paying occupations with lower levels of education (i.e. Teacher's Aide, Nurse's Aide, College Freshman). 

# Bivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?

The average Borrower Rate was decreasing significantly from 2012 to 2014.

The average Loan amount went down steeply in Q4 2008 and rose steadily until 2014.

The Quantile of DebtToIncomeRatio and Median BorrowerRate are correlated.

Borrowers without a credit grade have borrower rate that is average relative to the othersâ€¦

BorrowerRates are cleanly distributed among the different prosper ratings. (in contrast to the credit grades which overlapâ€¦)

Borrowers without a prosper rating have a median borrower rate that is average relative to the othersâ€¦

The Median BorrowerRate goes down as income range goes up.

There is a clean and linear relationship between the StatedMonthlyIncome Quantile and the Median BorrowerRate.

Unemployed borrowers have a significantly higher Median BorrowerRate than the others.

Homeowners have a lower median BorrowerRate than non-homeowners.

The worst States to get a loan are Maine and Indiana. The Best States are Alabama and North Dakota.

In General, Higher Paying Occupations with a higher level of education (i.e. Judge, Computer Programmer Engineer) have a lower median borrower rate than lower paying occupations with lower levels of education (i.e. Teacher's Aide, Nurse's Aide, College Freshman). 

### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?

Credit score varies much less among different prosper ratings than it does with credit gradesâ€¦

Most borrowers who have an IncomeRange Recorded have a StatedMonthlyIncome that falls within this range, however there are quite a few exceptions.


### What was the strongest relationship you found?

The strongest Relationships were between the BorrowerRate and CreditGrade, and BorrowerRate and ProsperRating.

# Multivariate Plots Section

## Overview
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots1,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=BorrowerRate),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth=.01)+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)
```

The distribution of borrower rates is less even from 2009 through 2012.

This may have to do with the relatively low number of borrowers during that time period.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots11233,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
p1<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_histogram(binwidth=1)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
p2<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
p3<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=LoanOriginalAmount),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,ncol=1)

p2<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=1/BorrowerRate),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,ncol=1)
```

The average loan amount is closely correlated with the number of loans given out.

The inverse of the BorrowerRate seems to follow the trends in the number of loans and LoanOriginalAmount by about 2 years.

## CreditGrade&Ratings

#### Credit score by Quarter
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots2qewgfdsg,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=CreditScoreRangeLower),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=quantile,probs =.1, linetype=2, color='blue')+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=quantile,probs =.5, linetype=2, color='blue')+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=quantile,probs =.9, linetype=2, color='blue')+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


```

#### CreditGrade/ProsperRating
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots2.2sdf22,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  geom_line(aes(group=ProsperRating..Alpha., color=ProsperRating..Alpha.),
            stat="summary",fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=BorrowerRate,),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  geom_line(aes(group=CreditGrade,color=CreditGrade),
            stat="summary",fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Ok, now I get it... The company used credit grade to determine the 
borrower rate up until 2009 and then started using their 
own metric namely, the Prosper Rating

Lets make a new variable to separate the the ealier loans from the latter.
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots3asdfgwe,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
loanData$CreditGradeOrProsperRating <-loanData$LoanOriginationQuarter %in% levels(loanData$LoanOriginationQuarter)[0:14]
```

#### Credit Score
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots5sdrge43523,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=CreditScoreRangeLower),data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  geom_point(alpha=1/5)+
  facet_wrap(~CreditGradeOrProsperRating)

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=CreditScoreRangeLower),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   !is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter,ncol=4)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.2,0.4))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=CreditScoreRangeLower),
       data=subset(loanData,
                   !is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter,ncol=4)+
  geom_line(stat="summary",fun.y=median,color='red')+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(0.1,0.3))+
  ylab("Median BorrowerRate")
```

Credit score is correlated to Borrower Rate, although that correlation changes by quarter.

As of 2009, there is a strict cutoff at a credit score of 600.

It looks like there isn't much variation in Borrower Rate by credit Score for those borrowers with a credit score of less than 600.

I will define bad credit as having a credit score of less than 600 and treat these loans as a separate category.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots5.23252rew22,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
loanData$BadCredit <-loanData$CreditScoreRangeLower<600
```

## LoanOriginalAmount

#### LoanOriginalAmount by quarter
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots62353245,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),data=loanData)+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter,ncol=4)+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0.2,0.4))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmountQuantile,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginalAmountQuantile)))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter,ncol=5)+
  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median,color='red')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

p1<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==TRUE))+
  geom_point(aes(color=CreditGrade))+
  facet_wrap(~Term,ncol=1)

p2<-ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==FALSE))+
  geom_point(aes(color=ProsperRating..Alpha.))+
  facet_wrap(~Term,ncol=1)

grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=1)
```

There is at least some relationship between LoanOriginalAmount and BorrowerRate. 

All loans in the earlier period are 3 year loans.

#### LoanOriginalAmount by quarter and credit grade 
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots734236,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating))+
  geom_point(aes(color=CreditGrade))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==TRUE))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~CreditGrade)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmountQuantile,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==TRUE))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)+
  geom_line(aes(group=CreditGrade,color=CreditGrade),stat='summary',fun.y=median)+
  ylab("Mean BorrowerRate")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))


## do a cor.test by credit grade here, when I figure out how to do that...
```

The correlation between the borrower rate and the loan amount becomes higher as the CreditGrade goes up...

#### LoanOriginalAmount by quarter and ProsperRating for 3 year loans
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots825yrew,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==FALSE&Term=='36'))+
  geom_point(aes(color=ProsperRating..Alpha.))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)
```


It looks like loan original amount was used to determine the BorrowerRate up until 2011.

Lets look at this in a bit more detail...
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots8.1276348762,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,LoanOriginationQuarter %in% levels(LoanOriginationQuarter)[15:20]&Term=='36'&!(ProsperRating..Alpha.=="")))+
  geom_point(aes(color=ProsperRating..Alpha.))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,LoanOriginationQuarter %in% levels(LoanOriginationQuarter)[15:19]&Term=='36'))+
  geom_point(alpha=1/5)+
  facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha.)

ggplot(aes(x=log10(LoanOriginalAmount),y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,LoanOriginationQuarter %in% levels(LoanOriginationQuarter)[15:19]&Term=='36'))+
  geom_point(alpha=1/5)+
  facet_wrap(~ProsperRating..Alpha.)
```

The correlation between loan amount and borrower rate also goes up as prosper rating goes up.

#### 1 and 5 year loands
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots8.12fdrew55sgtw,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==FALSE&Term=='12'))+
  geom_point(aes(color=ProsperRating..Alpha.))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)
```

1 year loans were only offered as of Q4 2010, so the loan original amount 
clearly does not effect the borrower rate for any such loans.

```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots8.132465322fdsgtw,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginalAmount,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==FALSE&Term=='60'))+
  geom_point(aes(color=ProsperRating..Alpha.))+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)
```

the same goes for the 5 year loans...

## Income Level
```{r echo=FALSE, multivariate_plots.726345341876321895876,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)&!is.na(IncomeRange)))+
  geom_line(aes(group=IncomeRange,color=IncomeRange),stat="summary",fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=LoanOriginationQuarter,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)&IncomeRange%in%levels(IncomeRange)[1:4]))+
  geom_line(aes(group=IncomeRange,color=IncomeRange),stat="summary",fun.y=mean)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The median borrower rate is related to IncomeRange.

```{r echo=FALSE, multivariate_plots.ar324532ewur,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(aes(x=log10(StatedMonthlyIncome),y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)&IncomeRange%in%levels(IncomeRange)[1:4]))+
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)+
   theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(x=StatedMonthlyIncomeQuantile,group=1,y=BorrowerRate),
       data=subset(loanData,!is.na(LoanOriginationQuarter)&IncomeRange%in%levels(IncomeRange)[1:4]))+
  geom_line(stat="summary",fun.y=median)+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)+
  ylab("Median BorrowerRate")+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The trend towards lower BorrowerRate for higher StatedMonthlyIncome is consistent accross all of the quarters.

#### StatedMonthlyIncome
#####CreditGrade
```{r echo=FALSE, multivariate_plots.asfasdfgsagdaf325iy32y7y,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

  geom_line(stat='summary',fun.y=median)+
  facet_wrap(~CreditGrade)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=StatedMonthlyIncomeQuantile,group=1),data=loanData)+
  geom_line(stat="summary",fun.y=median)+
  facet_wrap('ProsperRating..Alpha.')
```
#####ProsperRating
```{r echo=FALSE, multivariate_plots.asf325iy32y7y,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

data=subset(loanData,CreditGradeOrProsperRating==FALSE))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(500,10000))
```

StatedMonthlyIncome Varies significantly more accross different ProsperRatings than it does accross different CrediGrades.

## Debt

#### DebtToIncomeRatio
```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots123454555.2134,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

The trend towards higher BorrowerRate for Higher DebtToIncomeRatio is consistent accross all of the quarters.

#### AvailableMonthlyIncome

loanData$AvailableMonthlyIncomeQuantile<-

           with(subset(loanData,

              quantile(AvailableMonthlyIncome,
                    seq(0,1,.1))),

  geom_line(stat="summary",fun.y=median)+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter,ncol=5)+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

The quantile Of Available Monthly income is correlated to the median Borrower Rate.

# Multivariate Analysis

### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?

The average loan amount is closely correlated with the number of loans given out.

Credit score is correlated to Borrower Rate, although that correlation changes by quarter.

As of 2009, there is a strict cutoff at a credit score of 600.

There isn't much variation in Borrower Rate by credit Score for those borrowers with a credit score of less than 600.

The correlation between the borrower rate and the loan amount becomes higher as the CreditGrade goes up.

The correlation between the borrower rate and the loan amount becomes higher as the Prosper Rating goes up.

There is a correlation between loan amount and borrower rate exists up until 2011.

The median borrower rate is related to IncomeRange.

The trend towards lower BorrowerRate for higher StatedMonthlyIncome is consistent accross all of the quarters.

The trend towards higher BorrowerRate for Higher DebtToIncomeRatio is consistent accross all of the quarters.

The quantile Of Available Monthly income is correlated to the median Borrower Rate.

### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?

The inverse of the BorrowerRate follows the trends in the number of loans and LoanOriginalAmount by about 2 years.

CreditGrades were only used up until 2009, after which ProsperRatings were primarily used to determine BorrowerRate.
ProsperRatings Are much less dependent on CreditScore.

All loans in the earlier period are 3 year loans and 1 and 5 year loans are only offered as of 2011 (after LoanOriginalAmount was no longer used to determine BorrowerRate).

StatedMonthlyIncome Varies significantly more accross different ProsperRatings than it does accross different CrediGrades.

### OPTIONAL: Did you create any models with your dataset? Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model.

#### I creted the following linear models, in order.

(The models apply to a subset of the data taken from 2006 to 2009 with a CreditScoreRangeLower of 600 or less.)

##### Using CreditScoreRangeLower and LoanOriginalAmount
R^2: 0.3977

##### Using log10(CreditScoreRangeLower), LoanOriginalAmount and DebtToIncomeRatio
R^2: 0.4214

##### Using CreditScoreRangeLower and LoanOriginalAmount
R^2: 0.4505

(For the final model, the data is further subsetted to exclude DebtToIncomeRatios above 0.5)

The best model accounts for 45% of the variation in the Borrower Rate.

### Description One

The average loan amount is closely correlated with the number of loans given out, while, the inverse of the BorrowerRate follows the trends in the average loan amount and number of loans by about 2 years.

### Plot Two
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.height=10}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,x=reorder(Occupation, BorrowerRate,FUN=median )),data=loanData)+
  geom_boxplot()+
  coord_flip()
```

### Description Two

In General, Higher Paying Occupations with a higher level of education (i.e. Judge, Computer Programmer Engineer) have a lower median borrower rate than lower paying occupations with lower levels of education (i.e. Teacher's Aide, Nurse's Aide, College Freshman). 

### Plot Three
```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(aes(y=BorrowerRate,
           x=log10(CreditScoreRangeLower-600)*-1.259e-01+LoanOriginalAmount*2.485e-06),
       data=subset(
    loanData,
    (CreditGradeOrProsperRating==TRUE)&CreditScoreRangeLower>600&IncomeVerifiable=="True"))+
  geom_point(alpha=1/5)+
  geom_smooth(method='lm')+
  facet_wrap(~LoanOriginationQuarter)

```

### Description Three
Variation in the BorrowerRate from 2006 to 2009 is explained primarily by the LoanOriginalAmount and the log transform of the Credit Score for the borrowers with a credit score of over 600.

# Reflection
This prosper loan data is a rich dataset with multiple inerrelated variables. It is also relatively sophisticate with many changes over time over the course of the data collection. 

In my investigation of the BorrowerRate, I was able to find some interesting trends, and was able to create a linear model a sebset of the data with high variance. However, I was not able to fully understand all of the factors influencing the BorrowerRate in this investigation. 

While it is reasonable to expect that there would be natural variation in the data, it is likely that a loan company such as this one would use a rigorous method to calculate risk separately for each borrower, and distribute the borrower rates accordingly. If this is the case, reverse engineering the method used for the BorrowerRate would require a more thorough investigation of all of the data available in the dataset.
